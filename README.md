## Todo

[ ] Create a full write-up  
[ ] Organize code better  
[ ] Add code snippets to demo  
[ ] Detail when a user would want to choose each solution, provide real-world examples  
[ ] Convert to Sass, figure out better inheritance/composition/organization of styles  
[ ] Demo Justin's idea for a solution: Walk up the shadow host tree looking for elements that have a certain property that'll contain theme styles, and apply them. This could incur some cost, but there's some memoization that can be done to reduce it. Similar to ThemableMixin I believe.
